Automatically converts keywords into contextual in-text Amazon affiliate links

== Description ==

The uContext plug-in automatically locates keywords in your content and turns them into YOUR 
Amazon contextually related affiliate links. This is a great plug-in if you 
have a blog with lots of posts, or you have lots of blogs and need something quick, easy, and 
effective to monetize them.

Why make a couple cents per click when you could potentially make $5, $15, $20, or more per sale?

= Solution for Ad Blindness =

uContext is a perfect solution for ad blindness. When most people have learned to ignore your banners 
and Adsense links, your in-text affiliate links get clicked because they're right 
where your visitors are looking...  IN YOUR CONTENT.

= You're in Control =

Unlike other in-text contextual advertising services, you're in control of everything...

* How many links appear in your content
* Style your affiliate links using CSS or leave them defaulted to your site's style
* Turn off auto-keyword discovery and only have links for the keywords you decide
* Browse for better product matches to your keywords
* Choose the category and other filters for the type of products to create affiliate links to

= Upgrade to the Premium Version =

Our premium version adds...

* Click reports showing when and what keywords got the most clicks
* Bulk keyword editor for easier, faster management of all your keywords
* Set site-wide keywords to be use first when uContext tries to create links
* Set page/post specific keywords to be use first when uContext tries to create links on the page/post
* Link designer so you don't have to mess with your stylesheets to customize they way your affilaite links look
* Affiliate link widget shows the affiliate linked product titles relatived to the page/post being displayed.  This is a nice Adsense alternative.
* Customize the redirection link for affiliate links (for link cloaking)
